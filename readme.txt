Ananta pre-alpha preview version 2
================================

Unzip all files to a folder of your choosing and run main.exe.
XML files in "conf" folder should be self explanatory.
If you wish to run the game in full screen, change <bitdepth> 
setting to 16 or 32 in settings.xml or hit alt+enter ingame. 
You may also want to adjust <resolution> to a more comfortable setting.

In this pseudo-randomly generated scenario you start in the orbit of a planet. 
The orbit is all but stable because of the close proximity of other planets 
and the central star. Fiddle with the viewport/map zoom controls to have 
a better view of the surrounding solar system and galaxy.

This preview version features a procedurally generated galaxy which you can
have a look at through the starmap (key g).

Play around with the various gravity wells and push asteroids 
around to alter their trajectories. Use drifting AI ships and
asteroids for target practice. The former shoot back ;)
